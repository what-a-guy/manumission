<H1>Manumission</H1>
<p>A command-line utility for building Windows-style <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Compressed_HTML_Help">HTML help files</A>.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to supply a free software alternative to the Microsoft
Help Workshop.  Not only should a developer be able to create a help file outside of Windows, but should also be able to automate the build using the command line.</p>
<p>Why use the CHM format?  Because it offers several advantages over other alternatives:</p>
<UL>
<LI>Many users are already familiar with this format.</LI>
<LI>All help data is contained in a singe file.</LI>
<LI>Very good CHM viewers already exist on non-Windows platforms.</LI>
<LI>Contents, search and index tabs make the interface easy to use.</LI>
</UL>
<p>Most of the features available to HTML help are planned for manumission, with the exception of the "merge" feature.</p>
